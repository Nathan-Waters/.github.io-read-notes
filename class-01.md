Structure is made of elements that are made up of a but usually 2 tags. <br>

Basic HTML elements set up most web pages (all reflect the above html formate): <br>
-body: will have all elements that appear on the web page. <br>
-head: contains information about the page. <br>
-title: titles the page, typically only displayed in the URL. <br>

-div: used to group other elements and turn them into block-level elements. <br> 
-span: used much like the div element but instead to turn them into inline-level elements. <br>
-iframe: creates a windown in the webpage, think of google maps when looking for a store. <br>
-meta: multiple very useful purposes such as search engine optimization, and when browsers clear a users cashe. <br>

Escape Characters <br>
-example: \<, \", and(unironically) \&. <br>
