# Notes from Read: Growth Mindset
[Home](README.md)


- the biggest things I learned was not get frustrated. Learning is a part of life and its always a struggle. Learning is something we have to do everyday and need to LEARN to love learning.
- Deliberate practice seems like an important lesson. Putting yourself in uncomfortable situations is the best way to develop your skills. Feedback is not fun but its essential to developing yourself in anyway.
- Having the right goals is imperative. Knowing how to make the right goals is extremely important.
