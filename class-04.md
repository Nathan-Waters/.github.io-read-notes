Writing links <br>
- a: element with an href="website link" folowed by the button that will be pressed. <br>
- absolute URLs are for different sites, relative for same page/site. <br>

directory structure <br>
- parent means a folder below and grandchild is two. <br>
- relative URLs are most useful within your own website. <br>
- every / entered into the url is another folder back that the link is reaching to. <br>

Links <br>
- mailto: : sets the link up for an email. <br>
- target : attribute that can be added that will open another window for it. <br>
- linkes to parts of the page can be done with the use of ids. <br>
- linking to a specific part of another page is similar but with the folder routing. <br>

- Controlling the position of elements <br>
- creating site layouts <br>
- Designing of different sized screens <br>

key concepts in positioning elements <br>
- block-level elements: h1, p, ul, li <br>
- inline elements: img, b, i <br>
- containing elements are whatever has holds other elements in them. <br>

Controlling the position of elements <br>
- normal flow: every block line element has its own box going down the page. <br>
- relative positioning: moves the element from the position it would normaly flow to. <br>
- absolute positioning;: does not effect any of the elements surrounding it. <br>
- fixed positioning: positions on the page itself. <br>
- floating: take it out of the normal flow and move it left or right. <br>
- for more specifics pg 365-370

Floats <br>
- floats can be used to put elements next to eachother. <br>
- clear can declare that no element should touch the left or right hand sides of the box. <br>
- creating multi-column layouts is done with manipulating width, margin and then positioning. <br>

Screen size and resolution <br>
- each screen that you look at the internet though has a different screen size and resolution. <br>
- we tend to make pages at 960 px to accomidate for none pc screens. <br>
- Fixed Width Layouts: look good, great control of the page, but not scaleable <br>
- Liquid layout: fits to the screen size, can ruin good looking pages. <br>
- example of fixed layout pg 383 and liquid on page 385. <br>
- Grids layout: based on a 960 px width, divide into columns. <br>

multiple style sheets
- we can set up multple sytle sheets for the same web page. <br>

## Layout Summary
- div elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page. <br>
- browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify realative, absolut or fixed positioning. <br>
- the float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to creat multi-column layouts. <br>
- pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. <br>
- designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 px. <br>
- grids help create professional and flexible designs. <br>
- css framewors provide rules for common tasks. <br>
- you can include multiple CSS files in one page. <br>
