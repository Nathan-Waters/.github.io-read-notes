What is an object?
- set of variable and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. <br>
- variables become properties, functions become methods. <br>
- literal notation: easiest and most popular way to create objects. <br>

DOM tree
- a DOM tree is the layout of a web page. <br>
- Document node: represent the start to a page. <br>
- element nodes: describe the structure of the tree. <br>
- attribute node: not children of elements but attributes. <br>
- text nodes: cannot have children, contains text and anothe child element. <br>
- references pg 188. <br>
- methods that find elements in the DOM tree are called DOM queries. <br>

Working with Queries
- getElementById(): selects a slingle elment node by its id.<br>
- getElementsByClass(): select elements whose class attribute contains a specific value. <br>
- getElementsByClassName(): allow you select elements whos class attribute contain specific values. <br>
- getElementsByTagName(): select elements using their tag name. <br>
- querySelector(): returns first element node that matches the CSS-style selector. <br>
- You can loop through a node just like you can with an array. <br>

Get/Update Element Content <br>
- when you select a text node you can retrieve or amend the content. <br>
- textcontent: property allows you to collect or update just the text that is in the containing element(inclueding children). <br>
- Using innerHTML property, you can access and ament the contents of an elemnt, including any child elements.

Adding elements using DOM Manipulation <br>
- create the element: using the createElement() method. <br>
- give it context: can skip. <br>
- add it to the dom: appendChild() specify what element you are selecting. <br>

Removing elements via dom manipulation
- store the element to be removed in a variable. <br>
  - select the element you want to remive. <br>
- store the parent of that element in a variable. <br>
- remove the element from its containing element. <br>
  - usually with removeChild(). <br>

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks <br>
- adding innerHTML to your page can cause vulnerabilities in security. <br>

Defending against XSS
1. only let visiters input the kind of characters they need. <br>
2. double-check validation on the server before displaying user content. <br>
3. the database may safely contain markup and script from trusted sorce. <br>
4. as your data leaves the database, all potentially dangerous characters should be escaped. <br>
5. make sure that you are the only inserting content generated by users into certain parts of the template files. <br>
6. do not create DOM fragments containing HTML from untrusted sources. <br>

XSS <br>
- validation and templates: best defence is to prevent unwanted characters. <br>
- any content generated by users that contains characters that are used in code should be escaped on the server. <br>

attribute nodes <br>
- once you have an element node, you can use other properties and methods on that element node to access and change its attributes.
-hasAttribute(): method to check if any nodes exist wht that attribute. <br>
