# Chapter 6: CSS Layout

Understanding display
- inline display acts like words in a paragraph(right next to eachother, room permitted). <br>
  - you cannot set  a specific width or height on inline elements. <br>
- block display acts like the header, always stacked on top of eachother. <br>
- the display property also expands to children.

flexbox
- layout mechanism for one dementional layouts, either virtical or horizontal. <br>
- flexbox will align the element's children next to each other. <br>
- it will then strech them so they are all the same height. <br>
- itmes will stay on the same axis and not wrap when they run out of space. <br>
- they use things like align-itmes, justify-content, and flex-wrap properties. <br>
- flex: grow, string, basis. all attributes to be added but have a short hand of flex 1 0 auto. <br>

Grid
- display: grid; allows you to make a templet and dop elements into them. <br>
- useful gird layout unit is fr which just means fraction. 4, 1fr == 1/4th. <br>
- grid-row: 1/3; and grid-column: 1/4; are both used designate where elemnts go. <br>

flow layout
- inline-block, makes it ignor margin and padding. <br>
- floats, allows you to wrap text around an image. <br>
- multicolumn layout, allows you to break up elements into different columns. <br>
