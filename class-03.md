- limiting max and min widths helps adjust for screen size. <br>
- overflow can be hidden or given its own scroll bar. <br>

border, margin and padding <br>
- they are applied in that order within the page. <br>
- they adjust how much space is in between each element and where. <br>
- width can be adjusted as a whole, or individuale portions. <br>
- style will change what the border looks like, see pg 310 for examples. <br>

Centering content
- set right and left margins to auto
- text-align center

Changing inline/block

- inline-block and none are also options. <br>

Hiding Boxes
- sometimes you may want entire boxes to be invisible. <br>
- visibilty is the call for that. <br>
