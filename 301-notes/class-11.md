Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	
Relational Distributed Database
Good for complaex Queries

NoSQL
Non-relational or distrubuted Database
Document Based Key-Value Pairs 	 
Highly preferred for large data sets, stored in key-value pairs. 	 
 	 
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

What is a relational database?
A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?
A relational database consists of a collection of tables, each having a unique name.

What is a ‘schema’?
A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is inclusive of logical constraints such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities.

What is a NoSQL database?
A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

How does it work?
Instead of tables and relations they have documents that closely resemble JSON and don't require the same schema.

What is inside of a Mongo database?
Mongo DB stores information in BSON data, which is very similar to JSON data.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB since it requires no schema.It relies less on relations.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Duplicate Data, you have to adjust data on every single instance that the item appears on.
