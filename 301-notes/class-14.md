Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

When are diversity efforts most successful?
When they are driven by commitment from company leaders!

Why do diverse companies perform better?
They bring more viewpoints to singular problems and therefore can come up with more efficient and quick ways to solve problems than a non-diverse one can.

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
Youtube for example, when a fully right-handed team built an iOS app and that resulted in 5-10% of videos being uploaded upside down.
