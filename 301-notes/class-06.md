## 6 reasons for pair programming

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- I would say job interview readiness. It both helps you learn from others by trying to understand what they want you to do as the driver. As the navigator it helps you articulate what you want the driver to actually do. This helps with you communications skills as well as your understanding of how the code works. 

How does pair programming work?
- One persone drives, this person will actually be writng code in the IDE. One person Navigates, this person is telling the driver what to write, but not always the exact sytax. the navigator should be coming up with the end goal and keeping more than just what is being coded in mind.
